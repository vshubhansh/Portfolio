Size in html : 

1. 10px = 10 pixels
2. 10% = % of the screen
3. 1.5em =	1.5 times the font size

Media queries are easy ways to provide styles based upon the size

Three ways of using the media query
1. Linked CSS. Ex <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width : 500 px)" href="">  
2. @media only screen an (min-width : 500 px)
{
	body{
			display=none;
		}
}
3. @import  url("abc.css") only screen and (min-width: 500px)
(Refrain from using it as it has high perf impact)


Linked CSS had many small http requests
@media has few large http requests



Break point is a resolution size where user can see visible changes in the layout design of a page.
