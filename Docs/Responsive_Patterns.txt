Response Patterns :

There are 4 major types of response patterns
1. Mostly Fluid

Column Drop : At its narrowest point all the columns are stacked vertically over each other. As the screen size increases the columns move to the horizontal level one by one

Layout Shifter is the most commonly used pattern

Off Canvas is generally used to hide out the menu and selection options in a hamburger icon in case of small resolution
